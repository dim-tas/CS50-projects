1.  getrusage returns resource usage measures for some processes.

2.  16 members
  
3.  We use before and after to calculate so as to pass to the calculate function the values which are

5.  Becuase we may have scanned strings with symbols or numbers.

6.  So as not to be somehow corrupted by the functions.

7.  I used hash table with every field of the hash table being the head for a sinlgy linked list. The nodes

8.  My code was fast enough when comparing it with the staff solution.

9.  I didn't make any change.
